As the droplets of water fall to the ground, they form rain.\n\nHow does rain form?\n\nRain is a natural phenomenon that occurs when water vapor condenses into water droplets of water. This is the process that occurs when water vapor condenses into liquid water. The water vapor condenses into water droplets of water when it is cooled below the freezing point",
