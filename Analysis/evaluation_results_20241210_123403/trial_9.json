    "instruct_response": "Rain is caused by the interaction between the atmosphere and the land surface. It is caused by the interaction between the temperature of the air and the temperature of the land surface. The air is warmed as it rises, and the warmer air rises and cools as it descends. The air then cools and condenses, which releases water vapor. The water vapor then falls as rain.",
