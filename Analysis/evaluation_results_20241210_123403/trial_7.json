    "instruct_response": "Magnets are made of iron atoms that are held in place by a magnetic field. The field is created by a magnet that is placed near the magnet and a coil of wire that is used to create an electric current. The current creates a magnetic field that attracts or repels the iron atoms.",

    "base_response": "Rain is the result of water being absorbed by the soil and then evaporating. The water evaporates from the soil and then condenses into clouds. The clouds then drop water to the ground.\n\nHow much rain does a storm bring?\n\nHow much rain does a storm bring? The amount of rain that falls on a given day is called the precipitation. Precipitation is measured in millimetres, centimetres, or grams.\n\nWhat is the difference between rain and snow?\n\nSnow is formed when water vapor from the atmosphere condenses into a liquid. \u2026 Rain is formed when water vapor from the atmosphere condenses into a liquid. Snow is formed when water vapor from the atmosphere condenses into a solid.\n\nWhat are the 3 types of precipitation?\n\nThere are three types of precipitation: rain, snow, and sleet. Rain falls from clouds, snow forms in the atmosphere, and sleet forms when snow falls.",
    "instruct_response": "Rain is caused by the warm and humid air rising over a colder landmass.",

    "prompt": "Why do we have seasons?",
    "base_response": "The seasons are caused by the Earth's tilt. When the Earth is tilted at a certain angle, it is getting more or less sunlight at different times of the year. The Northern Hemisphere is getting more sunlight during the summer months and less during the winter months.\n\nHow do you know when it is winter or summer?\n\nThe season is determined by the Earth's tilt. The Earth's axis of rotation is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees. The northern hemisphere experiences summer, while the southern hemisphere experiences winter. The Earth's tilt is also responsible for the seasons.\n\nWhat are the 5 seasons?\n\nThe five seasons are: Winter, spring, summer, fall, and winter. The first two seasons are called spring and summer. The last two are called autumn and winter.\n\nWhat are the 3 seasons?\n\nThe seasons are: Spring, summer, and autumn. The first two seasons",
    "instruct_response": "Because seasons are caused by the Earth's tilt. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees, and this causes the sun to appear to rise in the east and set in the west. As the Earth rotates around its axis, the sun appears to move from east to west, and this causes the seasons.",
