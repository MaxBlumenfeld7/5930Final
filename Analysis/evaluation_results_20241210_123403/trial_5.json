    "prompt": "What makes rain fall?",
    "base_response": "Rain is a natural phenomenon that occurs when water droplets from the air fall to Earth. Rain is the result of evaporation, which is the process by which water from the air changes from a gas to a liquid.\n\nHow does rain fall?\n\nRain is formed when water vapor in the air condenses into rain droplets. The water vapor is a gas, so it can\u2019t stay in the air forever. As the water vapor cools, it turns into a liquid, and then it turns back into a gas.\n\nHow does water evaporate?\n\nWater evaporates from the surface of the Earth when it comes in contact with the air. The water vapor in the air condenses into water droplets, which then fall to Earth as rain.\n\nWhat is the cause of rain?\n\nThe cause of rain is caused by the evaporation of water from the surface of the Earth. When the water vapor in the air condenses, it forms droplets",
    "instruct_response": "Rain is caused by air pressure and moisture in the atmosphere.",

    "base_response": "The Earth\u2019s axis of rotation is tilted 23.5 degrees from the plane of its orbit around the sun. This means that the northern and southern hemispheres of the planet experience seasons.\n\nThe Northern Hemisphere experiences summer, and the Southern Hemisphere experiences winter. The Earth\u2019s axis is tilted 23.5 degrees from the plane of its orbit around the sun. This means that the northern and southern hemispheres experience seasons.\n\nThe Earth\u2019s axis of rotation is tilted 23.5 degrees from the plane of its orbit around the sun.

    "instruct_response": "We have seasons because Earth's tilt causes the sun to move across the sky at different angles throughout the year. This causes different amounts of sunlight to reach different parts of the planet. The amount of sunlight that reaches a particular area determines how much of the day is in the day and how much of the night is in the night. This is why we have seasons.",
